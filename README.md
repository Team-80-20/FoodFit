# FoodFit
FoodFit's Client Side Repo

**Author**: Ariel Altaras, Devin Cunningham and Ryan Johnson

**Version**: 1.1.0 Our first release of the FoodFit 80/20 applicaiton.

## Overview
The FoodFit 80/20 app combines the searchability of healthy meal recipies with a variety of creative fitness activities.

This application was designed for the on the go business professional who cares about their health but has little time to consider dinner plans, and physical activity.

Using the Edamam.com API as our recipe source database, we created a user friendly web application with simple searchability and the ability to store/remove recipies found by your search query.

This site also includes a variety of fun fitness activities to inspire the user to consider their physical fitness as well as their dietary health. 

## Getting Started
Creating an app can be as simple or as complex as the designer would like. First, find a well documented API that inspires your creativity. Then build a basic web app that can communicate with your database and return basic JSON data. Next create a mobile first, single page document format to parse your data and build it out to appear to the user as the client or designer intends. Lastly, fix all of the bugs you created along the way and refactor redundent code. Test, fix, repeat until you have a finished product.

## Architecture
FoodFit uses html, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, page.js, node.js, express,normalize.css, handlebars, and the Edamam API.
